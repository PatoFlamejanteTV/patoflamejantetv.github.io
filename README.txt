so, I feel kinda guilty that I had to erase my old code, but it was for a bigger reason.

after my changes, now people who access "PatoFlamejanteTV.github.io" or "quack.is-a-good.dev" gets redirect to my MAIN website (the "PatoFlamejanteTV" repo).

you can check the older commits for the older code, maybe I will continue to develop my old codebase, only maybe...
